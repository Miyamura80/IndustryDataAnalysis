Marimo notebooks constraint: each variable name must be defined in exactly one cell. Do not redeclare the same variable (e.g., `fig`, `labels`) across cells; instead, keep related code in one cell, wrap in a function, or use unique, descriptive names (e.g., `pie_labels`, `icicle_labels`) or private names prefixed with `_` when separation is needed to avoid collisions.
